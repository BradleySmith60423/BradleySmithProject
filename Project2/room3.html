This horrible thing is what we named "the Devilish Spider-Creature"!
It has many limbs, just like a spider would.
Additionally, it has two terrible horns and completely black scleras.
Look closer and you'll see five razor-sharp claws on the end of each limb!
We aqcuired this one quite recently, so we haven't been able to determine if it can see with those eyes.
Anyways, snap away, people! A picture is worth a thousand words!
