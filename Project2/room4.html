On display in ths room is our Hungry Giant!
We call him hungry for a very good reason.
The other tour guides won't tell you the full story, but I always do.
What kind of tour would this be if I left out all the dark details?
You see the staples around the beast's mouth?
Rumor has it that this goliath snatched up several people before we were able to stop it's rampage.
Take as many pictures as you want, but I wouldn't get too close if I were you!
